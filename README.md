# FileDropBoxTestApplication

Small test application.
Clean Architecture, MVP(VM) using Moxy in Presentation Layer.
Uses DropBoxApi(V2).

Following additions can be done in the future:
1. Exception handling system.
2. Refactored architecture (it is far from perfect at the moment).
3. Testing (None done as by now).
4. File preview photos, may use picasso.
5. Saving real files instead of file metadata.
6. KeyStore for API16.
